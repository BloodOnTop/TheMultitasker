- [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#readme) >= v10.2.0

## Installation

clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/eyalmichon/TheMultitasker.git
```
then inside the project folder use the following command to install required packages:
```
npm install
```
next, make sure all of the dependencies are installed.

Now you'll need to create a senders file in json format at `./handler/util` which you can use to save your group/private numbers for different functions safely without being part of the code.

#### Example senders.json:

The group info needed here is the JID of the group. (which looks like this "\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*@g.us")
Same thing for regular users (which is the phone number with @c.us appended)
```js
{
  "Me": "****@c.us",
  "Allowed": [
    "****-****@g.us",
    "****@c.us"
  ],
  "WelcomeMsg": ["****-****@g.us"],
  "RedAlerts-MessageOnly": [""],
  "RedAlerts": [""],
  "ProjectEgg": "****-****@g.us",
  "Fartictionary": "****-****@g.us"
}
```
Now if you want to use any api that is using image uploading / music recognition / better background removal you'll need to create an account on [imgur](https://imgur.com) and get a client ID and secret and place them in a new secrets.json file located at `./handler/util` folder .

#### Example secrets.json:
```js
{
    "Imgur": {
        "ID": "*********",
        "secret": "***********************************"
    },
    "ACRCloud": [{
            "host": "******",
            "endpoint": "******",
            "signature_version": "******",
            "data_type": "******",
            "secure": "******",
            "access_key": "******",
            "access_secret": "******"
        }],
    "removebg":["******"],
    // you'll need to get this yourself from mage dot space
    "imagineSecrets": {
        "apiUrl": "",
        "enhanceUrl": "",
        "refferer": "",
        "googleApi": "",
        "x-client-data": "",
        "x-client-version": "",
        "x-firebase-gmpid": ""
    },
    "AISecrets": {
      // you'll need to get this yourself from one ai dot come
        "oneai": {
            "keys": [
            ],
            "apiEndpoint": "",
            "AISignInAPI": ""
        },
        "contentDetector": {
          // you'll need to get this yourself from writer dot com
            "short": {
                "apiEndpoint": ""
            },
            // you'll need to get this yourself from copy leaks dot com
            "long": {
                "apiEndpoint": "",
                "referrer": ""
            }
        },
        // you'll need to get this yourself from excuses dot ai
        "excuseGenerator": {
            "apiEndpoint": "",
            "referrer": ""
        },
        // you'll need to get this yourself from ideas ai dot com
        "randomIdea": {
            "apiEndpoint": ""
        },
        // you'll need to get this yourself from dream interpreter dot ai
        "dreamInterpretation": {
            "apiEndpoint": "",
            "referrer": ""
        },
        // you'll need to get this yourself from air ops dot com
        "sql": {
            "apiEndpoint": ""
        }
    }
}
```

Now, inside index.js change `executablePath` path in the options to where you've installed chrome OR try the `useChrome` option and it may guess the location corretly.
